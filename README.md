# Hash Tables

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define hash functions and hash tables.
- Articulate the benefits of hash tables as they relate to speed of data access.
- Define collisions and how to resolve them.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Linked Lists

## Homework Instructions 

Complete the activity as outlined below. When you are finished, submit an an issue answering the exit ticket questions to summarize your learning on this topic! 

Unless otherwise stated, homework is due by 10:00 am ET the next morning.

## Activity

There are three components to this lesson, in the following order: 
1. myGA Module 1: [Introduction to Hash Tables](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/512)
2. myGA Module 2: [Hash Tables Deep Dive](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/761)
3. [Exercise: Implementing a Hash Table](/hashtable.js)

**To do the in class exercises, you can either...**

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/ZPQZrx) provided by the myGA Hash Tables Deep Dive module
1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the same (but the codepen has testing)

## Additional Resources
- Handy visualizations for a [closed addressing hash table](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/OpenHash.html) and an [open addressing hash table](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ClosedHash.html).
- Twenty fun interview questions, all related to [various hashing techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-hashing-technique-based-interview-questions/).
