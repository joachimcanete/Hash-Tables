# Hash Tables

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define hash functions and hash tables.
- Articulate the benefits of hash tables as they relate to speed of data access.
- Define collisions and how to resolve them.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Linked Lists

## Activity

There are three components to this lesson, in the following order: 
1. myGA Module 1: [Introduction to Hash Tables](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/512)
2. myGA Module 2: [Hash Tables Deep Dive](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/761)
3. [Exercise: Implementing a Hash Table](/hashtable.js)

**To do the in class exercises, you can either...**

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/ZPQZrx) provided by the myGA Hash Tables Deep Dive module
1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the same (but the codepen has testing)

## Additional Resources
- Handy visualizations for a [closed addressing hash table](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/OpenHash.html) and an [open addressing hash table](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ClosedHash.html).
- Twenty fun interview questions, all related to [various hashing techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-hashing-technique-based-interview-questions/).
